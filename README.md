## Installation

  Inquirer@8.2.4, Test

## Usage

  Open terminal and navigate to the location where you want the folder, run npm init-y to start Node.js and create a package.json file, run npm install inquirer@8.2.4 in order to get the npm, open the package.json file to make sure the package is included in the dependencies, and create index.js file to start using the package.

  Open terminal and run npm install --save-dev jest and it will install jest. Open the package.json and make sure there is a scripts object with the "test": "jest" inside it, otherwise you have to add it in.
